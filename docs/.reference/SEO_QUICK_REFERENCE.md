## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content
❌ Keyword stuffing → ✅ Natural keyword placement
❌ Thin content (<1500 words) → ✅ Comprehensive (2000+ words)
❌ Generic/AI-written → ✅ Personal examples + developer voice
❌ No internal links → ✅ 3-5 contextual links per page

### Technical
❌ No meta descriptions → ✅ Unique, compelling on every page
❌ Same description everywhere → ✅ Customized per page
❌ Missing schema markup → ✅ Schema on all articles
❌ Slow page speed → ✅ <2.5s LCP, 90+ Lighthouse

### Strategy
❌ Publish and forget → ✅ Update, promote, measure monthly
❌ No measurement → ✅ GSC + GA4 + tracking sheet
❌ Random topics → ✅ Strategic keyword targeting
❌ No internal strategy → ✅ Planned content clusters

## Final Reminders

✓ **Quality > Quantity** - One 2500-word comprehensive guide beats three thin 800-word guides

✓ **People First** - Write for developers, optimize for search engines (not the reverse)

✓ **Consistency Wins** - Regular publishing (3/week Month 1, 2/week ongoing) matters more than sporadic big posts

✓ **Measurement Drives Improvement** - What gets measured gets improved

✓ **Internal Linking is Underrated** - Proper internal structure multiplies SEO impact

**This strategy can deliver 5000+ monthly organic sessions within 12 months. Start this week.**
